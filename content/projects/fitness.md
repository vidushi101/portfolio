## Introduction

To upskill myself with the tools and techniques of data analysis I took the 9 months long **[Google Data Analytics Certification](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_campaign=B2C_INDIA_google-data-analytics_google_FTCOF_professional-certificates_arte-agency_desktop&utm_content=B2C&campaignid=17653505036&adgroupid=138609709419&device=c&keyword=google%20data%20analytics%20certificate&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=&creativeid=608046438717&hide_mobile_promo)** all the while I was working a full time job. During the final stages of this certificate course , a capstone case study is a requirement.To fullfill this requirement I took up this interensting project on the **data retreived from a fitness band that we routinely use these days**. I did this project to brigabout ideas to enhance the marketing strategy for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products, specially curated for women.

The aim was to **Gain insight into how consumers are using a popular fitness smart-device.** and use these insights to **help guide future marketing strategies for Bellabeat products.**

I completed the capstone project and hence the **[certification](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Y2viGcFUwPALfzTmfV0CjBvIcVMZrtK/view)** in late September 2022.


## Working

### Tools used:

**Data cleaning and transfromation**: Microsoft Excel and R programming language to-  
- Ensure the naming consistancy  
- Check and Remove duplicates  
- Make consistant date formats  
- Store time and date in different columns  
**Data analysis and Visualisation** : R programming language with use of Libraries such as     
*Tidyverse*,   
*dplyr*,   
*janitor*,   
*ggplot2*,  
 *lubridate*  and   
 *skimr*

 I utilised these to find out:
 **audience that Bellabeat must target to enhnace their marketing response**
 and the **features that Bellabeat can include in their App and market to draw customer attention**

## Output
Few of the output visuals that I created
- 1)Finding out the target audience according to the most active duration of the day

- 2) Finding out the relation between nergy expenditure throughout the day and sleeplessness while in bed.
