## Background
A **Tableau**  dashboard build to explore the results of a survey undertaken by the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). The DHS are nationally representative household surveys that have a smaple size between 5,000-30,000 households, conducted every 5 years.  

The survey, done in 70 countries, collected responses from people who believe that physical abuse(physical hurt) by a husband is justifed for one or more reason. 
The data can be filtered based on the demographic groups of age, employment status, education level, maritial status, and dwelling environment. Responses to induvidual questions can also be seen.

## Motivation for the analysis
The recent world women's day and simultaneous social attacks on women got me thinking about how our society is progressing when it comes to Women and various forms of injustice towards them. Consider the recent Hijab row , Isn't it a form of social and mental abuse? curtailing the women's right to choose for herself? 

We, as a society are still hard-wired to dictate how a woman should dress or behave. We even go ahead and justify the actions of others, when women or girls do not act in accordance to their mindframe. These notions are so mundane now, that a major section of their supporters are women themselves. 
The harsh truth is that none of this is a false claim. 

## Interesting Results
- Role of education:  
Data in the dashboard depicts how **women are more likely to change their their regressive bent of mind with education as compared to men**.   
However, Induvidual results among countries show high variations:
**Burundi** gave a drop of almost 44% in Female and 31% in male thinking supporting the bodily harm  
**Maldives** on the other hand , depicted a measely change of 1.3% in the mindset of both genders with education.

This raises an important question: **Is imparting education enough to change the mindset of your countrymen and women? if not, what else can be done to do away with this notion?**

- Role of Age:
Data here tells that **It is our younger generation, that is becoming more intolerant and resloving to physical violence.**  
The results here are even more staggering as they concluded that **the female poulation, the ones who are suffering, are the ones who advocate this behaviour more than their male counterpart!**
