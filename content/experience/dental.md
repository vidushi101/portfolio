After completing my 4 years dental education , I enrolled in 1 year of rotary dental internship spannig across 8 dental specialities.

 - Performed dental procedures and filed **e-health records** of incoming patients.
 - **assisted in launch of tele-consultancy** for patients during the COVID-19 period. 
 - worked in a grass-root level hospital setting and understood the patient's needs and flaws in our healthcare system.

 ### What did I learn here?
My role as a dental Intern taught me about:
- the fundamentals about the need of e-healthcare systems.
- the **working and ins and outs** of a hospital administration sytem.
- flaws in the Indian helathcare system.
