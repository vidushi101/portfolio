- Here I effectively analysed and processwd the data in **over 200 health individual case safety reports (ICSRS)**, resulting in meeting regulatory compliance and kpi before the deadline. 
- I successfully **discussed and implemented plans** as well as workflows to **enhance project delivery of project goals and client satisfaction**.

- Health databases and the health protection laws related to **HL7 and PHI**.
- working in a **team environment** to reach acommon goal.
