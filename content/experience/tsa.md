  I joined Oracle Cerner in July 2022 as a **Technical Solutions Analyst** for **Cerner Millennium** solutions, the flagship product of Oracle Cerner.

 - As part of my role , I was trained on the various applications of the EHR software , their backend workflows, their relevant tools and build.
 - As an **SME** on the concerned applications and tools, I analysed  and investigated the client workflows, databases, log files and front-end issues to **resolve nearly 70 clinical application software issues requests** on a monthly basis.
 - I utilised the **CCL (Cerner Command Language), a SQL-based programming language developed by Cerner** to Query the client database and retreive the critical information for the code level investigation.
 - Troubleshooted the backend issues, worked on several domains and provided solutions to **reduce the yearlong backlog by 25%.**
 - Analysed, manipulated and maintained **critical health data** using tools such as **BMC      Remedy, Jira, Supportal, MyJarvis, DragonDrop and  code search**, all the while maintaining the integrity of **PHI and HL-7**.
 - Was **Awarded** as the **"Prime Player"** in the alligned solution for the 2022 monthly duration.

### What did I learn here?
My role as a solutions analyst taught me about:
- Utilising SQL to retrieve and amnipulate data.
- the EHR software systems, their workflows and build.
- the **Cerner Millennium** software package.
- Health databases and the health protection laws related to **HL7 and PHI**.
- **The role and of asking the right questions and looking in the right place to find answers during your analysis**.
